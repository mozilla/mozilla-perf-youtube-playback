# How to deploy media files

Per https://github.com/mozilla/perf-youtube-playback/pull/2#discussion_r291044871,
the media files are large and rarely changes if at all. Thus it is deployed manually
as of this writing.

To deploy it, run `./deploy.sh media`.

Please [file a bugzilla ticket](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Cloud+Services&component=Operations%3A+AMO)
to have the media file deployed.
