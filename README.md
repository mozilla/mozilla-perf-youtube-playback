# perf-youtube-playback

This repository is a mirror of the 2019 branch from the
https://github.com/youtube/js_mse_eme/ repository,
with some customization for Raptor applied.

It is used for executing the raptor-youtube-playback
performance tests.

The description of the original repository is:

js_mse_eme is an externally-published tool that is aimed to test the validity
of a browser's HTML5 Media Source Extension and Encrypted Media Extension
implementations. As an added bonus, this tool is used by YouTube to certify
hardware electronic devices (e.g. TVs, settop boxes, etc...).

Year specific tests and tools are in the respective branches.
